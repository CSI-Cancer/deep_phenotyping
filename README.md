# **Contrastive Representation Learning for Single Cell Phenotyping in Fluorescent Whole Slide Imaging of Enrichment-free Liquid Biopsy**

## **Project Overview**

This project develops a **deep contrastive learning framework** for identifying and stratifying single cells in whole slide immunofluorescence microscopy images derived from liquid biopsies.

Tumor-associated cells obtained from liquid biopsies hold promise for **cancer detection, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring**. However, their **rarity, heterogeneity, and plasticity** pose challenges for precise identification and characterization, particularly in clinical contexts.

## **Key Contributions**

* **Robust Cell Identification:**
  Introduces a deep contrastive learning framework to robustly identify and classify circulating cells from whole slide images.

* **High Classification Accuracy:**
  Demonstrates **high accuracy (92.64%)** in classifying diverse cell phenotypes.

* **Enhanced Downstream Performance:**
  Improves the performance of downstream tasks, including **outlier detection and clustering**.

* **Automated Rare Cell Identification:**
  Enables automated identification and enumeration of distinct rare cell phenotypes, achieving:

  * **Average F1-score of 0.93** across cell lines mimicking circulating tumor cells and endothelial cells.
  * **Average F1-score of 0.858** across circulating tumor cell (CTC) phenotypes in clinical samples.

* **Scalable Analysis Pipeline:**
  Provides a scalable analysis pipeline for tumor-associated cellular biomarkers, facilitating **clinical prognosis and personalized treatment strategies**.
